There is, however, the testimony by Cecil Williamson, that as a boy, during World War One, he saw four or five drunken farmworkers stripping an old woman at North Bovey, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon, to search her for a witch’s teat on the assumption that she had bewitched their cattle. They were halted by the vicar, and their victim later revealed herself to Williamson as a wise-woman and commenced his instruction in cunning craft. There is something odd about this account, for belief in a witch’s teat, along with the associated one in a suckling demonic familiar, was by the nineteenth century not a west country one, but confined to East Anglia. If true, it is by far the most recent occasion of a witch-mobbing ever recorded, more than half a century after the last properly documented one: ‘A Conversation with Cecil Williamson’, *Talking Stick* 7 (1992), 26–7.[447][141.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-141) Davies, ‘Decline in the Popular Belief’, 42–219, and ‘Cunning Folk’, 104–5.[142.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-142) Davies, ‘Decline in the Popular Belief’, 195.[143.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-143) Maple, *Dark World*, 142–3.[144.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-144) Ibid.*,* 143–9.[145.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-145) Newman, ‘Witchcraft in the Eastern Counties’, 32.[146.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-146) *County Folk-Lore II,* 187–9.[147.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-147) *The Croydon Chronicle* (8 November 1856), 3c.[148.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-148) Davies, ‘Urbanization and the Decline of Witchcraft’, 600–1, and ‘Cunning Folk’, 101.[149.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-149) Palmer, *Folklore of Warwickshire,* 82–3; *Folklore Society News* 16 (1992), 12–13.[150.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-150) Hardwick, *Traditions, Superstitions and Folklore,* 120–1.[151.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-151) Davies, ‘Decline of the Popular Belief’, 217–19, 326–52, and ‘Cunning Folk’, 104.[152.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-152) Davies, ‘Decline of the Popular Belief’, 351–75.[153.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-153) Brown, ‘Charming in Devon’, 47.[154.](015_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch6_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-6-note-154) Davies, *Cunning-Folk*, 194–7; Baker, *The Cunning Man’s Handbook*, 517–23, 537\.

彼得·曼德勒，“反对“英国化”，*《皇家历史学会会报》*第 6 辑 7 (1997)，155-76，有力地反对夸大这一立场，表明“农村神话”只是社会的一部分，而不是在整个英国占主导地位。他的话是很好的，并没有减少我自己的情况，这只是取决于这个“神话”在文学文化的重要部分流行的信念，在这个时候没有受到直接的攻击或反对。同样，约翰·阿什顿，“超越生存主义”，*民俗* 108 (1997)，19-24，提醒我们，英国地方包含了许多重要的民俗收藏家，他们并不分享当代对异教生存民俗的关注。这并不能改变这样一个事实，即他们没有提出任何替代理论来挑战后者，而且“生存论”在主持这场运动的大都市学者中占主导地位。

Dave Evans and Dave Green (Bristol: Hidden Publishing, 2010), 40–61\. None the less, nothing like Leland’s witch cult has been found in modern Italian folklore: it makes the best fit, as said, with late medieval learned demonology.[72.](017_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch8_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-8-note-72) It has now been published, as Charles Godfrey Leland, *The Witchcraft of Dame Darrel of York*, by The Witches Almanac, in 2011.[73.](017_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch8_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-8-note-73) Ronald Hutton, ‘Revisionism and Counter-Revisionism in Pagan Studies’, *The Pomegranate*, NS 13 (2011), 245–7.[74.](017_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch8_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-8-note-74) George Lawrence Gomme, *Ethnology in Europe* (1892), 48–57.[75.](017_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch8_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-8-note-75) Karl Pearson, ‘Woman as Witch’, in *The Chances of Death and other Studies in Evolution* (1897), vol.

This book was based upon a full use of the Order’s archive at Luton. Its publication caused disquiet among some members, resulting in a decision to close the archive for a period sufficient to allow more distance to be put between the Order’s earlier history and the present. This was the point at which I sought access to it. I obtained this on condition that I cited only the published items within it, and four specific letters in which I was especially interested. I was duly admitted, with the greatest degree of kindness and trust, and shall honour that by adhering to the terms; although I included within them a brief to check the accuracy of Derek Edgell’s use of manuscript documents (which is perfect) and to state if necessary what is not in the collection; which may be important later, as readers will see. I would like to thank Charlotte Jones and Julian and Sue Brown for their support in this delicate process.[58.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-58) Edgell, *Order of Woodcraft Chivalry,* 1.[59.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-59) Pitt Rivers Museum, *Westlake Collection,* Box 2, five letters, 11 May-19 September 1909.[60.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-60) Edgell, *Order of Woodcraft Chivalry,* 65, to which more can be added from the list appended to Ernest Westlake, *The Place of Dionysos* (Woodcraft Way Series 9, 1927).[61.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-61) Ernest to Aubrey Westlake, 17 September 1917 and 29 July 1921, in Archive of Order of Woodcraft Chivalry, file A.m.[62.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-62) Westlake, *The Place of Dionysos,* 9–22.[63.](018_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch9_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-9-note-63) Aubrey T.

I am very grateful to him for this correspondence, and to John Matthews for making the introduction which opened it. However, on reading his own biography of her, *Dion Fortune and the Inner Light* (Loughborough: Thoth, 2000), and his editions of her manuscripts in the Inner Light archive, *The Circult of Force*, *Principles of Hermetic Philosophy*, and *Spiritualism and Occultism*, all published by the same press between 1998 and 1999, I remain unconvinced by his case. I think that the new material that he has thus made available fails to clinch it, and equally well supports mine.[86.](019_part1_chapter.xhtml#r_ch10_actrade-9780198827368-miscMatter-10-note-722) Martin Seymour-Smith, *Robert Graves* (London: Hutchinson, 1982), 383–430; Richard Perceval Graves, *Robert Graves and the White Goddess* (London: Weidenfeld, 1995), 58–104\.

Patricia Crowther, in her autobiography *One Witch’s World* (London: Hale, 1998), 49–57, tells of how in 1962 she was sent material from a Scottish family witch tradition, which to her confirmed the existence of pagan witchcraft as an unbroken tradition from the remote past. The rituals were similar to Gardner’s and yet had differences; the difficulty in dealing with such material will be explored in Ch. 15 of the present book. For Patricia Crowther the most important evidence was the gift of an *athame* (by that name) which had allegedly belonged to her correspondent’s grandmother and had the same shape and signs as those upon the Gardnerian *athame*, which are slightly different from those of Mathers’s printed text of the *Key of Solomon*. It was clearly worn by use. However, employment of a tool over a few years can produce significant wear, and that can also be deliberately applied; so better evidence is needed to demonstrate that this was not, indeed, a Gardnerian *athame* from the 1950s, which the lady had obtained with some reports of Gardnerian practice.[78.](021_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch11_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-11-note-78) Kevin Danaher, *The Year in Ireland* (Cork, 1972), 226; Mical Ross, ‘The Knife Against The Wave’, *Folklore* 105 (1994), 83–8\.

The term ‘Book of Shadows’ occurs earlier, in a book of poetry and drama published in 1929, by Helen Douglas Adams: ‘Ash’, ‘Helen Douglas Adams and the Book of Shadows’, *The Cauldron* 113 (2004), 37–8\. It is much less likely, however, that Gardner came across this obscure work, the main value of which is to display again that combination of a love of nature, of classical deities and fairies, and of the moon as a goddess, which had characterized so many British writers by this date.[466][87.](021_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch11_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-11-note-87) Unsurprisingly, Doreen Valiente testified that the passage concerned was definitely written by Gardner himself: Farrar and Farrar, *Eight Sabbats*, 42.[88.](021_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch11_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-11-note-88) ‘Ye Bok of ye Art Magical’, pp. 267–88\. These entries are printed in Kelly, *Crafting the Art of Magic,* 52–4, 67–72\. They are, however, reproduced there with some surprising inaccuracies, which do not cumulatively seem to serve any obvious polemical purpose so that they seem to be bizarre editing errors.

It is notable that Philip Heselton’s sense of Gardner’s willingness to embroider truth increases with Philip’s successive books. Both aspects of Gardner’s nature –the sweetness and the duplicity—have been enlarged for me in conversations and correspondence with Fred Lamond, Lois Bourne, ‘Dayonis’ and Zach Cox. In his foreword to Bracelin, *Gerald Gardner*, Gardner’s friend James Laver, a curator at the British Museum and reputable scholar, said that Gardner was a splendid fellow but avoided commenting on the reliability of his statements concerning his witchcraft. On the other hand, another of Gardner’s witch priestesses, Patricia Crowther, has always insisted on his absolute probity; but she was initiated later than the others, in 1960, and so worked with him as a witch for the least time. She has subsequently been the initiate of his most concerned to defend his reputation and legacy in its entirety.

See the newspaper reports cited in Valiente, *Rebirth of Witchcraft,* 10–14, especially Allen Andrews, ‘Calling All Covens’, *Sunday Pictorial* 29 June 1951, 6\. The relationship between them at this time is well researched and represented by Philip Heselton, *Witchfather* (Loughborough: Thoth, 2012), 410–65\. The best source for it are the letters from Gardner to Williamson preserved at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft at Boscastle, and I am grateful to the then owner, Graham King, for telling me of them when he acquired them and allowing me to read them. Gardner enthusiastically lent Williamson Wiccan magical tools as exhibits, clearly seeing the museum as a shop window for the religion and a platform for himself: he expected the artefacts to be displayed in a ‘Gardner Room’ (letter to Williamson 1 August 1953).[9.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-9) Allen Andrews, ‘Witchcraft in Britain’, *Illustrated* 27 September 1952, 19–20.[10.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-10) Warburg Institute, Gerald Yorke Collection, Scrapbook EE2, ff. 348–50\.

A first biography of Doreen Valiente was published by Jonathan Tapsell, *Ameth* (London: Avalonia, 2014), but has been largely eclipsed by Philip Heselton, *Doreen Valiente: Witch* (n.loc.: Doreen Valiente Foundation, 2016). The history of this coven before Doreen joined it is very hard to recover. Philip Heselton has convincingly argued that Gardner’s first initiate into Wicca was a woman from Cheshire called Barbara Vickers, whom he brought in at some point in 1950, and who in turn promptly initiated her husband Gilbert: *Witchfather*, 403–9\. This couple in Cheshire, and their initiates if they had any, would probably have been the ‘Northern Coven of British Witches’ of which Gardner spoke to Williamson in his letters 1951–3, while Gardner’s own one, which Doreen joined, was the ‘Southern’. Gerald subsequently claimed that the Vickers came from a traditional coven in their locality, but I am inclined to agree with Philip that ‘this was just another little invention of Gerald’s’ (p. 403). How Gardner’s coven grew between 1950 and 1953 is not known, although Doreen noted that at the latter date most were members of the Five Acres Club, which could have been the main recruiting ground (*Rebirth of Witchcraft,* 37). It is clear that Gardner had a coven up and running by 30 April 1951, when it held a ‘nice little May Eve rite’ (Museum of Witchcraft, Gardner to Williamson 1 May 1951), but not who was in it then, aside from Gardner, Woodford-Grimes and (sometimes at least) the Vickers, or where it met: the ‘Witch’s Cottage’, Gardner’s London flats, and Woodford-Grimes’s home are all plausible locations.[14.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-14) See the sources at n. 8, as well as the drift of all Williamson’s reminiscences, cited in this chapter and the last, and his pamphlet *West Country Witches* (Boscastle: Witchcraft Research Centre, n.d.). Philip Heselton explores the deteriorating relationship in *Witchfather*, 467–83.[15.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-15) For Gardner’s contribution to Manx lore, see Ronald Hutton, ‘The Chnaging Faces of Manx Witchcraft’, *Cultural and Social History* 7 (2010), 153–70\. Nichols’s role in preparing the book was confirmed by Doreen Valiente in her speech to the Pagan Federation on 22 November 1997.[468][16.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-16) *The Witch Cult in Western Europe* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1921), 13\. The first occurrence of the phrase ‘Draw Down the Moon’, in a Wiccan context, is in a letter from Gardner to Williamson at the Boscastle museum, which can be from internal evidence dated to early 1952.[17.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-17) Gardner, *Witchcraft Today*, esp. 26–7, 44–6, 166–72, 186.[18.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-18) Warburg Institute, Gerald Yorke Collection, Scrapbook EE2, n.p., Ameth to Yorke, n.d., and Yorke’s notes on it, December 1953, and Gardner to Yorke, 24 October 1952\. Gardner later persuaded more of his favourite initiates to pass themselves off as hereditary witches in the same manner: *Witchfather*, 403, 521\. The pretty witch in 1952 was Barbara Vickers: Museum of Witchcraft and Magic, Gardner to Williamson, 17 April 1951; and Warburg Institute Gerald Yorke Collection, Gardner to Yorke, 24 October 1952.[19.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-19) Janet and Stewart Farrar, *Eight Sabbats for Witches* (London: Hale, 1981), 45, 72–9, 93–101, 116–20, 148; Aidan Kelly, *Crafting the Art of Magic* (St Paul, MN: Llewellyn, 1991), 116–20\.

In the past few decades, another of Doreen’s compositions has assumed great importance in American Wicca, being the Dryghtyn (or Dryghton) or Blessing Prayer (or Rune): a recitation which declares belief in the origin of the cosmos to be in a single sexless and eternal divinity from which the goddess and god of Wicca, and elemental spirits, were engendered. Gardner had referred to the possibility of such a being (in *The Meaning of Witchcraft*, London: Aquarian, 1959, 26–7, 160) but suggested that Wiccans should not bother about it in practice. Doreen, however, embedded it in this new text, which she wrote in the 1960s and presented to friends who ran a famous coven usually called Whitecroft, who put it into their liturgy. Whitecroft was hugely fertile in initiates, British and American, who dispersed it very far.

然而，这个故事有两个复杂之处。一个是帕特丽夏·克罗泽，在她的第一本自传《女巫的血》中。(纽约:收藏品之家，1974)，39-40 页，引用了加德纳在她入会仪式中使用的文字(1960 年)。这种混淆在 *Pagan Dawn* 145 (2002)，23 中被消除了，当她有益地承认她在写她的书时用它代替了一部分真正的礼拜仪式。另一个复杂的问题是，在 20 世纪 90 年代，多琳告诉各种各样的人，她认为她是从加德纳的文件中看到的一些东西中获得这个想法的，尽管她已经不记得那是什么了。今天，在多伦多的那些文件中，没有一样东西幸存下来，或者被任何其他认识加德纳的巫术崇拜者所记得。然而，多琳经常引用其他人的作品作为她的灵感来源，例如阿普雷厄斯的古代文本中女神的出现作为第二部分的指控，或者*卡米娜·加德里卡*的圣诞礼拜仪式，或者是她另一个受欢迎的创作的詹姆士一世时期的戏剧，圣咏“黑色的灵魂和白色”。然而，在每一种情况下，她要么没有从原作中借用任何词语，要么借用很少，要么借用一行。Drihten (通常的拼法)只是盎格鲁-撒克逊语中“主”的意思，在基督教中常用作“上帝”。因此，多琳完全有可能看到了一部盎格鲁-撒克逊文本，或以此为基础的东西，它开始于“以*德莱廷*的名义”，而她的新柏拉图式的礼拜仪式也由此开花结果。在英国，她的文本功能是作为巫术崇拜者礼拜仪式的一个可选择的附加物，但是在美国的一些地方，它已经成为一个基本的信仰声明。

A file of documents in the Toronto Collection chronicles the whole sad story, and suggests strongly that Greene only met and turned to her mentor, Charles Cardell, after disillusion with Gardner, and so therefore that the spy tale is a fiction. Heselton, *Witchfather*, 587–605, tells the story in detail and reaches the opposite conclusion. A parallel story of rescuing a maiden from Gardner, put about by a rival magician, is that in Francis King, *The Magical world of Aleister Crowley* (London: Weidenfeld, 1977), 179–80\. It was told by Kenneth Grant, but as neither Doreen Valiente nor Fred Lamond can recall any of the characters or incidents concerned in this drama, its truth remains unconfirmed. Other doubts hang over the details of Grant’s story of a ritual in 1949 attended by Gardner, in Kenneth Grant, *Nightside of Eden,* and discussed in Valiente, *Rebirth of Witchcraft,* 50, and Mike Howard, ‘Gerald Gardner’, *The Cauldron* 84 (1997), 19.[35.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-35) Richard Perceval Graves, *Robert Graves and the White Goddess* (London: Weidenfeld, 1995), 326–7.[36.](022_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch12_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-12-note-36) ‘Witches’, *Daily Mail,* 1 October 1964, 15.

The presence of this lady in the Hertfordshire coven at this time is confirmed by two other surviving members of it, Frederic Lamond and the man who features prominently as ‘Enoch’ in Tanya Luhrmann, *Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft* (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989): Lamond, *pers. comms.,* 17 August 1996 and 19 June 1998, and ‘Enoch’, *pers. comm.·,* 9 July 1998\. There are, however, some discrepancies between their memories of her and those of Lois Bourne; they do not recall that she was a member of the coven for as long a term as Bourne implies, nor that her hereditary coven seemed, from her accounts, to be as grand or elaborate. Since then a lot more information has emerged on Monica English’s life—she was a good amateur artist and keen on fox-hunting, and married at this period to a rich timber merchant—but little on her coven. It is known now that she joined it after she moved to Norfolk in about 1953, and that according to the museum curator Cottie Burland, who knew her as well as Gardner, it used ‘very little ritual’: [http://www.deadfamilies.com/Z3-others/English/English-Monica-01.html](http://www.deadfamilies.com/Z3-others/English/English-Monica-01.html), accessed 29 November 2017.[3.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-3) E.

She wrote the text, while he supplied the photographs. Her interpretation of the figures followed that of Margaret Murray and Lady Raglan, cited earlier, but was rejected after further research in the remainder of the century, summarized in Ronald Hutton, *Pagan Britain* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 347–51.[34.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-34) For the history of the custom, see Ronald Hutton, *The Stations of the Sun* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), 218–25.[35.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-35) I have two personal reasons for gratitude to her. The first is that when making contact with me she sent me video copies of all the television interviews which she had given, to convince me of her claims. The second is that subsequently, and even after I had proved myself to be less immediately accepting than she had hoped, she heard from others that I was having a bout of illness and sent a charm, unsolicited, to heal me. I also have, however, a friendship with another woman who grew up in Longdendale in the 1960s and 1970s. This person was herself very interested in paganism and folklore, and became a Wiccan high priestess, yet she had never heard of the system of beliefs, rites and guardians outlined by the lady who had first announced them to Anne Ross. That suggests that if that system did exist before the 1970s, it was carried on by a very private group, without the knowledge of the wider local community. Such a group, including the woman concerned, certainly existed *after* her media appearances, and she herself acquired a reputation in the region of a latter-day folk magician. See A. J. N. W. Prag, ‘The Little Mannie with his Daddy’s Horns’, in *The Materiality of Magic*, ed. Ceri Houlbrook and Natalie Armitage (Oxford: Oxbow, 2015), 171–82, for a wonderful story of her influence on a group of Manchester Museum staff, who—according to your personal viewpoint—were either duped into believing that an African figurine (initially mistaken for an Iron Age horned god) had real occult powers, or came to recognize that it had.[477][36.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-36) David Clarke with Andy Roberts, *Twlight of the Pagan* Gods (London: Blandford, 1996); David Clarke, *Supernatural Peak District* (London: Hale, 2000), 106–14.[37.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-37) Anne Ross, *The Folklore of Wales* (Stroud: Tempus, 2001), 70–1, 103, 151–3.[38.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-38) For a summary of the problems, see Ronald Hutton, ‘Medieval Welsh Literature and Pre-Christian Deities’, *Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies*, 61 (2011), 57–85.[39.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-39) On this latter point, see Wirt Sykes, *British Goblins* (1880), 235–6.[40.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-40) The essential study of the heads has now been made by John Billingsley, *Stony Gaze* (Chieveley: Capall Bann, 1998).[41.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-41) Levannah Morgan, *pers. comm.,* 5 June 1998.[42.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-42) To some extent the successive issues of Mike Howard’s magazine, *The Cauldron*, chart the appearance of these individuals and groups, reflecting Mike’s desire, since the 1960s, to establish non-Wiccan pagan witchcraft as a coherent tradition with the same importance as Wicca and a greater age. In 2011, in *Children of Cain*, he produced a single work devoted to that ambition, by giving an account of those groups in that tradition which had emerged by the mid-1990s and taking their historical claims more or less at face value. He continued the enterprise with Daniel A. Schulke in 2016, when they edited *Hands of Apostasy* (n.loc.: Three Hands Press), revealing the sheer diversity of practices and beliefs which had by then collected under the label of Traditional Witchcraft while still trying to find a common source for them and identity to them.[43.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-43) Among the former, Tony Steele, Anna Franklin and Gemma Gary have produced particularly notable results. Among the latter kind of author, Paul Pearson and Tallis Harrill, *The Mountain and the Stream* (n.loc.: Windgather, 2017), and Tamzin Powell, *The Witches Ways in the Welsh Borders* (n.loc.: Airheart, 2017) seem to stand out. I am grateful to all three for the gift of their books, and for corresponding with me during the development of them.[44.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-44) I am grateful to Martin Watts, the recent curator of the museum, for sending me a photocopy of the whole work and also of the ‘Notes on Witchcraft in Ryedale’ by Bertram Frank which seem to establish its provenance: and for doing his best to locate any other relevant evidence. Patricia Crowther’s interpretation is in *One Witch’s World* (London: Hale, 1998), p. 201\. In 2001–2 she and I engaged in an extended correspondence over this and other matters, which led to our joint contribution to *Pagan Dawn* 145 (Samhain, 2002), 20–3, and to friendly relations which persisted for many years and included an annual exchange of Yule cards.[478][45.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-45) The founding text of his tradition was *The Azoetia* (Chelmsford: Xoanon, 1992), which he presented to me.[46.](025_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch15_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-15-note-46) Andrew Chumbley, *pers. comms.,* 239 March, 20 April, and 12 May 1996\.

The development of Y Plant Brân is described in a letter from a member, ‘Gwion’ to ‘Merc’ on 6 December 1971, in the Museum of Witchcraft, Boscastle, John Score papers of the Pagan Federation Archive. He testifies that Wynn Owen’s Welsh family tradition, which was not termed paganism or witchcraft, had ‘virtually no ritual but they did healing and kept the festivals. The latter mainly with games and fun for children.’ This is another fine summary of the quasi-magical, quasi-pagan folk culture which was one of the nurseries of pagan witchcraft. The same letter goes on to tell of how Wynn Owen developed the rites of Y Plant Brân proper after leaving the Regency, ‘recovering ritual and ceremonies’ by ‘looking closer into the old stuff’.

Aidan Kelly took it as the former (*Crafting the Art of Magic,* St Paul, MN: Llewellyn, xiii), which is also the version given in the interview with her in the *News of the World,* 9 April 1967, 4\. However, Maxine Sanders, who knew her well, gives the name as ‘Kasprzynski’: *Fire Child* (Oxford: Mandrake, 2008), 102–3\. Maxine also states that Alex was initiated into Wicca both by Kopinski, and by Medea, which either confuses things further, or simplifies them if they were actually the same person.[8.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-8) Crowther, *One Witch’s World,* 67–8\. the letter was published in Julia Phillips, ‘Secrets Revealed’, *The Wiccan* (Beltane 2019), n.p.

I did not know him well, but retain an impression of a soft-voiced man with a northern accent and initially shy manner, who talked with one leg crooked around his chair, liked pubs and expounded practical magic very ably. There are vivid portraits, naturally enough, in Sanders, *Fire Child*; and Di Fiosa, *A Coin for the Ferryman*.[34.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-34) Deutch, *The Ecstatic Mother*, *passim.* For a parallel portrait of Maxine in action at this time, see Margot Adler, *Drawing Down The Moon* (Boston: Beacon, 2nd edn, 1986), 94–6.[35.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-35) I am very grateful to Maxine and her family for agreeing to my use of these papers: now see also *Fire* *Child*, 101–4\.

Di Fiosa makes the bravest possible case for Alex’s initiation by his grandmother as genuine, without really clinching it: *A Coin for the Ferryman*, 37–44\. His is generally a fine biography, especially good on Alex’s life after 1967\. His apparent contempt for ‘academics’ is, however, a little sad, especially as he and I usually draw the same conclusions from the same sources. My own account of Alex’s life is in the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*.[483][36.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-36) Johns, *King of the Witches*, 15–28; Smyth, *Modern Witchcraft*, 115–18; Maxine Sanders, *pers. comm.,* 12 September 1998.[37.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-37) Farrar and Farrar, *The Witches’ Way*, 14–15; Margaret A.

This should emphatically not be taken as suggesting that other Wiccans, and especially Gardnerian Wiccans, were less practical and results-related in their magic. It only suggests that in interviews and lectures they tended to talk somewhat more about the Old Religion, and Alex and Maxine somewhat more about practical magic.[39.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-39) Johns, *King of the Witches*, 121; Maple, Witchcraft, 137; Sanders, *Maxine: The Witch Queen*, 144–5.[40.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-40) Bill Ellis, ‘The Highgate Cemetery Vampire Hunt: the Anglo-American Connection in Satanic Cult Lore’, *Folklore* 104 (1993), 13–35.[41.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-41) Valiente, *Rebirth of Witchcraft,* 173; Maxine Sanders, *pers. comm.,* 12 September 1998.[42.](027_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch17_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-17-note-42) *The Ilford Recorder*, 18 and 15 November, and 2 December 1971\.

He made regular appearances between 1989 and 1991 in the local newspapers of his area: occasionally in the *Kentish Express*; *Eastbourne and Hailsham News*; *Eastbourne Advertiser; Eastbourne Citizen;* and *Eastbourne Herald*; and frequently in the *Eastbourne Gazette*. His media forays continued for the rest of the century, with another flurry in 1996–7, when he was in the local papers again, and reached the *Sunday Mirror* on 28 July 1996, the *Independent* on 21 December, and the *Observer Magazine* on 23 February 1997, with an extended interview in *Yes!* magazine in which he made some of his grandest claims: my cutting is undated, but clearly from late 1996.[40.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-40) Helen Cornish, ‘Cunning Histories’, *History and Anthropology*, 16 (2005), 363–76, has found that ‘traditional’ witches increasingly claim descent from cunning folk rather than the victims of the witch trials; which, as I have suggested earlier, works well in terms of operative magic, but not as a pagan religion.[41.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-41) These generalizations are based upon many personal conversations and views and exchanges published in *Pagan Dawn, The Cauldron, Talking Stick*, *Aisling, The New Wiccan, White Dragon, Dragon’s Brew, The Singing Head, Comhairle, Dark Mirror, Pagan Dusk, Pagan Voice, Twisted Tree,* and *Manchester Pagan Wheel.* The division here was not entirely one between Wiccan and non-Wiccan witches. Patricia Crowther was an example, though a lone one, of a Wiccan elder who both remained isolated from the emerging national Pagan scene and—which can hardly been coincidental—devoted to the Gardnerian foundation legend. Likewise, some self-identified ‘traditional’, i.e. non-Wiccan, witches were favoourable to historical revisionism. More consistent was a division between ‘ins’ and ‘outs’. Overwhelmingly, the established Pagan leadership proved favourable to the new history, even if the process took time: the most remarkable example here is Michael Howard, the greatest single British publicist and supporter of non-Wiccan forms of witchcraft, who started the 1990s by expressing hostility to any challenges to the received history of Paganism and ended them as a loyal friend and ally of mine, who contributed much to this book. Conversely, those hostile to the revisionist history or disposed to ignore it, were overwhelmingly people who had hitherto been obscure, and who were trying to establish themselves as new leaders on the Pagan scene. For an example of what can happen when a historian investigates the historic claims made by one such newly-appeared tradition (though one which I think valid and effective enough as an actual spiritual system) see Jason Simmons’s treatment of Gemma Gary, in ‘Bucca Redivivus’, *Cornish Studies* 18 (2010), 141–61.[491][42.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-42) The single apparent prominent exception to this rule actually proves it: Jani Farrell-Roberts, who published her attacks on revisionism in England but had actually just arrived from Australia, after a stay in that latter country in which she had undergone an amazing triple conversion experience: from a Roman Catholic priest to a Pagan, a feminist and (by surgery) a woman. She came to Britain determined to establish herself as a leading Pagan there, and was infuriated to find that the story that she had been told about her new religion was generally no longer taken as true.[43.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-43) Of the established American Pagan leaders, Margot Adler, Isaac Bonewits, Judy Harrow, Oberon Zell, and Chas Clifton all embraced the revised history, and indeed became personal friends of mine. Starhawk, Z Budapest and the long-serving American Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wiccans all stayed out of the fray, and the main American Gardnerian magazine, *The Hidden Path*, eventually gave me a long and friendly interview.[44.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-44) This charge is the more ironic in that simultaneously some academic reviewers of the first edition of *Triumph of the Moon*—Marina Warner, Rodney Ambler and Alec Ryrie—while often having good things to say about the book, suggested that it was a work of ‘special pleading’ designed to ‘rose-tint’ or ‘whitewash’ pagan witchcraft by representing an unrealistically benevolent view of it. None of them produced any evidence to substantiate this charge, and it is difficult to see, given their state of knowledge, how any could have done so. It is actually very hard to find objective evidence of how far *The Triumph of the Moon* has acted overall as either a deterrent or attraction to people when dealing with that witchcraft. It may be significant that I have had a regular post bag from individuals who first encountered Wicca though the book, and subsequently chose it as their path with happy results; and another from intolerant Christians who have read the book, denouncing me as a friend to witches. Conversely, I have never yet receiced any letters from former witches thanking me for opening their eyes to the falsehood of their beliefs, or from people hostile to Paganism, praising me for discrediting it.[45.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-45) More extended pieces are represented by D. H. Frew, ‘Methodological Flaws in Recent Studies of Historical and Modern Witchcraft’*, Ethnologies*, 1 (1998), 33–65; Jani Farrell-Roberts’s articles in *The Cauldron* in the May and August issues of 2003; and Ben Whitmore, *Trials of the Moon* (Auckland: Briar, 2010). All of these have been posted on the world wide web by partisans. The last, the work of a New Zealand Wiccan, was a systematic, though still rather brief, attack on *The Triumph of the Moon*. It began by observing due courtesies, but soon abandoned those, and consistently engaged in specific dirty tricks, in addition to manifesting the general problems of counter-revisionist Pagan writing suggested below. Whitmore credited me with views which I not only did not express in my book, but explicitly disavowed. When I cited the work of other scholars in support of my findings, he pretended that it was my own, as part of a general policy of trying to represent me as isolated and unrepresentative among academics. When a work by another scholar clearly supported me at one point but at another made a statement which, taken from context, could be quoted against me, he ignored the former and highlighted the latter. When I stated something clearly and with full references in one of my works but dealt with it more sketchily and without full references in another, the former was, again, ignored, and the latter used in evidence. He had not read more than half of the publications I have made on the history of witchcraft and magic by the time that he wrote, and clearly had no idea of my relationship with British Wiccans, but pretended to be an expert both on my work and on me.

[492][46.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-46) There is a single honourable exception to all these rules: Max Dashu, *Witches and Pagans* (Richmond CA: Veleda, 2016). A Californian, she earlier in her career as an Internet blogger followed all of them, but in this first book made a refreshing break with tradition, by carrying out research in primary sources; treating academic historians with respect (while disagreeing with them) and not singling out any of them as villains; and attempting to write a proper history of pagan witchcraft which defends that propounded by feminist witches in the 1980s, though one which in this volume is confined to the early medieval period. Moreover, I think that she has some genuinely interesting things to say about folk motifs and mythology. I also, however, retain serious problems with her use of, and access to, evidence, and her resulting interpretations: my views are explained at length in ‘Witches, Pagans and Historians’, *The Pomegranate*, 18 (2016), 205–34.[47.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-47) Owen Davies, *America Bewitched* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013); Ian Evans, ‘Touching Magic’ (University of Newcastle, Australia, PhD thesis, 2011), which he has followed with a series of invaluable web sites.[48.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-48) Ginzburg’s book was translated with the title *Ecstasies*, and I have used the London, Penguin Books, edition of 1992\.

For a list of reviews of Emma’s work, see Hutton, *The Witch*, 332, n. 6\. One of the aspects of the misuse of the work of this group of historians by Pagan counter-revisionists is the attempt by some to set it up as a polar opposite to my own, when I have actually been more sympathetic to it than most historians. I dedicated *The Witch* to Carlo Ginzburg, and did my best to launch Emma Wilby’s career and help her first book to publication. My full relationship with the historiography concerned is recorded in various parts of *The Witch*.[55.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-55) I am myself starting to think, as I discussed at points in *The Witch*, that something else was going on as well, and that people at different levels of medieval and early modern Christian societies were capable of developing beliefs in new kinds of superhuman figure, which had nothing to do with Christianity and yet were not simply preserved from ancient times either; but that is a discussion for another place.[56.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-56) Early examples of the change were published in the *Sunday Times,* 21 August 1983, and *Living,* June 1984\.

The lone example of sustained hostility in the mid-1990s was the *News of the World,* a newspaper which had come to rely for sales almost wholly upon the tactic of the ‘shock exposé’, and by the new century—in the few years remaining before it was closed down following allegations of severe professional malpractice—even that had got tired of harrassing pagan witches.[57.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-57) The trials were of Colin Batley (Kidwelly, 2011), Peter Petrauske (Truro, 2012), Redvers Barnard (Manchester, 2015), and David Mace (Bristol, 2015): details of all are available on the Internet. I acted as an expert witness in two of them, not with respect to any of the details of the actual charges, but just to establish that Paganism in general did not require the its followers to behave as the accused were alleged to have done.[58.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-58) Jessica Berens, *Queen of the Witches* (London: Arrow, 1993); Freda Warrington, *Dark Cathedral* (London: Penguin, 1995), and *Pagan Moon* (London: Penguin, 1997).[494][59.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-59) For especially clear examples of his exploration of religious issues, see *Small Gods* (1992) and *Hogfather* (1996). His trilogy which affectionately satirizes Wicca is *Wyrd Sisters* (1988), *Witches Abroad* (1991), and *Lords and Ladies* (1992). All these titles were published in London by Gollancz and later brought out in Corgi editions.[60.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-60) A good collection of scholarly essays was published on this phenomenon: *The New Generation Witches*, ed. Hannah E. Johnston and Peg Aloi (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007). A parallel study of the use of witchcraft for self-empowerment in teen fiction is Christine Jarvis, ‘Becoming a Woman through Wicca’, *Children’s Literature in Education*, 39 (2008), 43–52.[61.](029_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch19_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-19-note-61) Some of the hostile prejudice which I myself encountered when writing this book, and immediately, after, is recounted in my essay ‘Living with Witchcraft’, in my collection *Witches, Druids and King Arthur*, 259–94\. I later discovered the situation to have been worse than I had realized. In 2010 I met an American colleague who told me that ten years before, soon after *The Triumph of the Moon* was published, he had visited Cambridge University and asked historians there what I was currently doing. He received the reply that he could forget about me, because I had gone mad, become a witch, and left the profession. Similar revelations had multiplied since. During these years invitations to me to address academic gatherings had indeed fallen off, and applications by me failed, in a way not known before; and there is no doubt that the writing of this book did real damage to my career, which I took a long while to make up. This was despite the fact that at no point had I actually identified myself as a witch, or indeed made any public reference to my own religious beliefs, if any, or discussed them with fellow academics or students. I had merely studied the wrong subject.

I did so with the encouragement of professional sociologists and social anthropologists to whom I had presented such material at academic events; but after the publication of the book most of the few members of those disciplines who took notice of this material rejected it, on the grounds that I had not gathered and processed it using their disciplinary methods, and had not set it in the broader context of modern British religion, by which they generally meant a Christian one. To study and adopt their methodologies now, to read up properly on that broader context, including all the research published on it since 1999, and (of course) to carry out my field work all over again, is impossible in the time permitted for the creation of this second edition. I have therefore deleted the whole section, so giving myself more space for historical information and reflections. The lost passages can remain in the first edition as a 1990s period piece, and their abandonment a witness to the problems of interdisciplinary engagement.

我更愿意放弃它们，因为自从这本书的第一版写出来后，已经产生了几个关于当代英国巫术崇拜者信仰和实践的学术研究，其中一些也评论了巫术崇拜者的历史。就书籍和论文而言，我们有乔安妮·皮尔逊的《宗教和魔法的回归》(兰卡斯特大学博士论文，2000 年)；以及*威卡教和基督教遗产*((伦敦:劳特利奇出版社，2007)；利奥·瑞克比，*巫术*(伦敦:黑尔，2004)，103–223；还有伊森·道尔·怀特、*威卡教*(布莱顿:苏塞克斯学术出版社，2016)；其中最后一个是最全面的全面覆盖。绿林、*魔法、巫术和其他世界*在这里也是相关的。在美国的对等物中，特别值得注意的作品是 Sabina Magliocco，*新异教神圣艺术和祭坛*(杰克逊:密西西比大学出版社，2001)；以及*巫术文化*(费城:宾夕法尼亚大学出版社，2004)(杰出调查研究)；琼斯·萨洛蒙森，《迷人的女权主义》(伦敦:路特雷奇出版社，2002 年)；妮基·巴多-弗拉利克*，来到圆圈*(牛津:牛津大学出版社，2005)。戴维·沃尔德伦(David Waldron)的《女巫的标志》(Durham NC: Carolina Academic Press，2008 年)对澳大利亚的异教巫术进行了总体调查，凯瑟琳·朗特里(Kathryn Rountree)的《拥抱女巫和女神》(伦敦:Routledge 出版社，2004 年)对新西兰的女权主义异教女巫进行了研究。与欧洲大陆相当的是莱昂·范古立克(Léon Van Gulick)，《凝视月亮者和开拓者》(蒂尔堡大学博士论文，2017 年)。此外，Sabina Magliocco 还在 1998 年编辑了《T21》杂志关于威卡教的特刊。Helen A. Berger(费城:宾夕法尼亚大学出版社，2005 年)包含了一些有用的文章。一些关于异教的一般性著作也有相关性，比如麦克尔·约克著名的《异教神学》(纽约:纽约大学出版社，2003 年)。由于篇幅的原因，我们忽略了自 1998 年以来由从业者或为从业者撰写的大量作品，如书籍、杂志文章、互联网博客和网站，这些作品揭示了威卡教的知识并提供了信息。我特别感谢朱迪·哈罗、劳拉·怀尔德曼、西尔弗·雷文沃尔夫和简·雷伯恩赠送了他们的书。

In this respect these authors were just asserting forcefully and dogmatically what had already become a tradition. In 1980 Gini Graham Scott had entitled her study of newly appeared religious groups in California (which included the first extensive survey of a modern pagan witch tradition) *Cult and Countercult* (Westport, CT: Greenwood). Stark and Bainbridge may well, however, have hardened an orthodoxy: in 1985 J. Gordon Melton lumped ‘Witchcraft, Neopaganism and Magick’ together as ‘newer cults’ in his *Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America* (New York: Garland). He defended this terminology on the grounds that ‘social scientists’ defined a cult as any religious group ‘foreign and alien to the prevalent religious communities’ (pp. 3–4).[22.](030_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch20_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-20-note-22) Simes, ‘Contemporary Paganism’, 369.[23.](030_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch20_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-20-note-23) Pre-eminently contributors to *Perspectives on the New Age,* ed.

Michael York, *The Emerging Network* (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 1995), associated the two without integrating them. Melton himself clearly distinguished them in his *Encyclopedic Handbook,* as does Scott, *Cult and Countercult.* Likewise, Steven Sutcliffe’s fine study, *Children of the New Age* (London: Routledge, 2003), implicitly distanced New Agers from Pagans and Wiccans. On the other hand, the British government publication, *Aspects of Britain: Religion* (London: HMSO, 1992), listed Wicca only as a contribution to the New Age Movement.[24.](030_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch20_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-20-note-24) Simes ‘Contemporary Paganism’, 490–8; Joanne Pearson, ‘Assumed Affinities: Wicca and the New Age’, in *Nature Religion Today,* ed.

This is argued with a powerful eloquence, but has not achieved general acceptance to date.[28.](030_part2_chapter.xhtml#r_ch20_actrade-9780198827368-chapter-20-note-28) Catherine L.
