# 【Caleb】如果你想要放弃显化，那就看看这个视频 - P1 - BeTheChangeee - BV1a3411m7Fp

 grated，I knew，呢，本，Wy attach，so i really did，today，about，understanding them you're live。

and how it's working，n choose，whatever you want the mirror of life god reality，infinite intelligence。

I'm just gonna use the mirror of life，ok，so，I'm gonna give some examples in this video。

that I've used before，but I think with a picture example。

it's gonna help people understand even better，so，um，in this example。

I want to talk about how the mirror of life，is reflecting，not who you think you are。

but who you are actually being，what you are truly embodying in that moment，so。

if any of you are interested，I do have a one-on-one coaching，I have a free Facebook group。

I offer courses and I have a patreon group，and that's all in the description below，ok。

so let's get into it。，Ok，so the main reason I'm making this video。

is because I know a lot of people in manifesting，when they start to struggle over something。

and it's been weeks months or years，they sort of start to develop this sense of apathy，like。

what's the point of going on，if you know God has rejected my desire。

if manifesting doesn't work for everything，if it doesn't work for me， etc。 right。

and I know I was at one point in my life，I was，you know in that mindset lower my chair real quick。

hold on。，There we go。，Ok，so，I made up this diagram that I want to show you guys。。

It's not too complicated。，Don't freak out。，I'll read it。，So this is a person right here。。

The person has a square body。，I put a milkshake in this hand and a flower in this hand。。

This is the person and they have a top hat on。，This is the mirror of life。，This is an example。。

I'll give in just a second and we'll talk about this stuff。。

So remember the mirror of life responds to who I am being，slash are who you are being who I am being。

and it does not respond to who I logically think I am being，Okay。

 so we've talked a lot about identity work in the，true identity。。

So let me give you an example real quick。，I'm gonna put this down and then I'll put it back up。。

So the thing is a lot of people because they discover。

conscious manifesting whether it's law of attraction or，law of assumption。。

They discover conscious manifesting from the perspective，of it's just your logical mind。。

Just think happy thoughts。，Just assume it's done。，SP loves me。，I am a millionaire that type of stuff。

 right？，And yes， it is true that in manifesting perception，shift is a part of it。。

So think of affirmations visualizing scenes scripting。

think of that as this you hold perceptions of things。

outside of you people objects places things and events。

most people though are being taught or how they're，understanding it maybe not being taught that way，。

but it's how they're thinking about it。，They're being taught that manifesting is just their。

logical mind。，It's just the logical thoughts up here and it's not so。

successful conscious manifesting if you want to get。

what you want every time think about it this way when。

your identity matches your perceptions that you are，changing。，That's the secret formula。。

You can also think of that as manage your energy and，control your perceptions along the way。。

So here's an example and I've given this example before，but I'm gonna give it again。。

Let's use an SP example。，This person right here and this is the mirror of life，，right？。

This person can keep affirming all day long。，SP loves me。，SP wants to be with me。，SP，SP，SP，SP，right？。

And that's part of perception work。，So there's nothing wrong with affirmations about an。

SP money car job， whatever it is。，But if when I come out of these affirmations my unconscious。

natural behaviors and perceptions do not align with。

 what I am changing my perception on that is showing， me my true identity。。

So here's the example with the SP。，I can say SP loves me right multiple times， but when。

I come out of that affirmation rampage that scripting。

that visualizing whatever you have you're focusing。

if I just naturally without even thinking about it，，right？。

It's just unconscious behaviors and actions and perceptions。

that I'm just driven to an example is I come out of。

that rampage and I immediately start stalking social，media。，Where is it？，Who are they with？。

What are they doing？，Why isn't it here？，I'm going to go to this manifestation form and complain。。

I'm going to complain。，Oops， my camera slip in a little bit。。

I'm going to complain to my manifestation buddies。，It's not here。，Where is it？，Where is it？。

Where is it？，I'm going to be too attached to the outcome。，I have too much importance on it。。

I need it to feel okay。，Let me try SP loves me，SP loves me，SP loves me。。

That right there is who you're actually being。，Remember the mirror of life responds to who I am being。

It doesn't care about who you think you are。，It is responding to who you are。。

So here is the good news because I really want this，video to bring a lot of hope or faith to people。。

If you have been struggling with something for a long。

time that you're trying to manifest because seriously， this really is good news。。

I want you to look at it from a totally different perspective。。

It is not because God has denied your desire。，Your prayer wasn't answered。。

It wasn't meant to be you have karma from a past life。，It wasn't because of any of that。。

It wasn't because manifestation only works sometimes，and not others。。

It's always working whether you believe it or not，and whether you know it or not。。

It's not because manifestation。，I can't figure it out in this one thing。。

You just weren't understanding and trust me guys。，I've been there。。

You just weren't understanding the mirror of life doesn't。

care who I logically think I am or keep trying to，convince myself that I am。。

It's going to respond to who I keep showing up as in，the world。。

So if my true identity I can do those affirmation，rampages， right？。

But if my true identity when I come out of that is， desperation lack need overly attached。。

Where is it？，This is what it's going to respond to。。

It's not going to respond to up here in the logical，mind SP loves me。，I'm a millionaire。。

It's responding to this。，So when I can get this in alignment along with this，perfect formula。。

So here's an example。，When I did this in my own life， my identity that I。

was coming from was I am an inconvenience to others。。

I don't belong as I am that was my true identity。，That was how I was able to put it into words。。

So in other videos when I've told people things，like your core identity issue is never or it's very。

so rarely ever something like I'm not worthy。，I'm not good enough。。

Those are feelings and thoughts that stem from the，identifying factor that's truly at your core。。

So when I did this work in my own life， remember how。

I told you guys my true identity that I realized，I was coming from I was very unaware of it was very。

unconscious was I am an inconvenience to others。，I don't belong as I am now imagine how many circumstances。

in my life in different areas that created and every。

time I emotionally responded to them and got lost，in the emotion what happened I was reinforcing the。

identity or the belief that created it in the first，place。，So yes， it is true。。

I definitely had deep feelings of rejection worthiness，not good enough。

 but those were all stemming as，byproducts from I am an inconvenience to others。。

I don't belong as I am and so this is why I keep，telling people because a lot of people will leave。

comments or say things like I think my identity，issue is I'm not worthy。，I'm not good enough。，No。

 that's not the issue。，It's very rarely as cut and dry and copy and paste，as I'm not worthy。。

I'm not good enough。，It is a unique identity to you because nobody has。

gone through your life experience that you built，about yourself。。

So just a quick FYI to start getting to the bottom，of your identity start noticing your triggers get。

a piece of pen and paper maybe a journal and any，time you get triggered by something it doesn't matter。

if it has to do with the subject of your manifestation，or not any trigger just ask yourself this one。

question。，What am I believing about myself in this moment？。

What is this revealing to me about myself right？，And what just let that first answer flow out on。

the pen and paper don't get the pen and paper，out and be like is it a b c or d is it multiple，choice？

，It's not a test you're taking just let the pen，and paper flow and that's okay。，Jot that down。。

You have another circumstance。，Another trigger start to notice your triggers。

and start to ask that question and you would be，surprised how easily you can start to make connections。

，Now。，I'm not saying here's an example。，Let's say I had a trigger and I and in that moment。

I was feeling rejected right？，I'm not saying just because you wrote I feel rejected。

and maybe you wrote I feel rejected over four，different circumstances。。

I'm not saying that's the core identity issue。，That is a very strong feeling and sub thought。

that's coming from the identity。，But if you can start to get these things down，。

let's say you had 10 circumstances throughout，the next couple of days and you wrote down。

I feel rejected。，I feel unimportant。，I feel not seen or heard you could actually look，at those right？

，Look at it as a recipe and maybe by putting，those three together and looking at them。。

You can come up with a sentence that is showing，you where this is stemming from just like mine。。

You see how very different I feel rejected。，I am rejected that feels then I am an inconvenience。

to others。，I don't belong as I am because I was made to，believe that as a child that right there was。

the true identity issue。，So why is identity so important because here's。

the thing when Neville Goddard for example，，was teaching the wish fulfilled right？。

He said assume that it's done right？，Manifesting is making a decision regardless。

if I have any evidence of it or not and it，is sticking with that decision not sticking，with it。。

Like I have to say it 700 times every hour，，but when I just think about the subject it's，done。。

I don't have to worry about this。，It's sticking with a decision faith in the reality。

unseen even though all physical senses see smell，hear taste touch deny it。。

Because in manifesting you rely on your sixth，sense the intuition your internal guidance。。

So the reason why identity work is so important，is because when you can get to the bottom of。

your identity and start to shift it，，which is not going to be an overnight process。

when you're not going to undo a lifetime of，this program of living this way in two days or。

just saying okay，，I'm accepted now。，You're not going to it's you're going to have。

to work through the resistance as it comes up，see through it for what it is。，I mean，。

there's going to be for some of you that may be，crying。，I mean，，it's it's not an overnight thing，。

but it doesn't have to take years either。，But the thing is the reason it's so important。

is because when you keep trying to change，your perception here，。

I'll write this down real quick one second。，When you keep trying to say sp loves me，or you know，。

I have a successful business。，I'm going to put business man or woman。。

So remember what we talked about earlier，perceptions your affirmations your scripting。

your visualizing are you changing your perceptions，of things outside of you？。

My bank account is full sp wants to be with me，，right and there's nothing wrong with that。。

That's fine。，But that's not the only thing that manifesting，involves true successful。

100% every single time。，So if you keep trying to say sp loves me，，right sp loves me。。

I am a successful business man slash woman，，but okay，，let's use the business man one or the business。

woman business man。，So I can keep saying all day long because I。

have a girl in my patreon group who's trying，to start her business and she's asked lots。

of questions about her business。，I can keep saying all day long。，I am a successful business man。。

I am a successful business woman，，right changing my perception of my business。

basically right and that's great。，That's a part of manifesting change your perceptions，of things。。

But if I come out of that perception changing，rampage or session whatever you want to call。

it and I immediately unconsciously without，even second guessing or thinking about it。。

My just unconscious actions are to check，the website。，Oh God，，it's not here yet。。

Maybe I should lower my prices。，Why is nobody booking？，That's showing me who I really believe I am。。

In other words，，that's that right there is what you're，embodying。。

So this is why I've told people affirmations，and scripting and visualizing are neither。

positive or negative like everything in this，world。，It is your relationship to it that matters。。

So for some people affirmations and scripting，and visualizing are actually a form of emotional。

reacting。，Why because they're affirming from the desperation。

the lack the need overly attached sp lesb，sp lesb sp lesb I am a millionaire。，I am a millionaire。。

I am a millionaire。，Right。，And so what they don't realize is the mirror of，life doesn't care。。

What's being set up here in the logical mind。，It's responding to what you are embodying in that。

moment。，So why identity work is so important in manifesting。

embodiment getting in tune with your body when，you feel an emotional reaction you search to。

feel where sometimes you can feel the energy in，your body，。

right when you're angry feel heat in your face，，maybe your fingers tingle that type of stuff。。

I know when I get angry for tingles in my hands。，The reason it's so important is because when。

you have an identity that doesn't match the，perception thing that you're changing the perception。

that you're changing the identity is what's going，to keep knocking you out of the state of the。

wish fulfilled。，It's what's going to keep knocking you out of it。

is done making your assumption even Abraham，Hicks talks about this for you people that are。

law of attraction Abraham Hicks said she wrote，a book called asking it is given just like Neville。

Goddard when you ask in prayer like Goddard，said believed you have received and you will in。

the Bible says that to other religious books also，but in other words，。

it's already done because you're understanding，it's done in here in imagination in heaven in。

non physical my inner world AbrahamHicks calls，the vibrational reality。。

It's done in here first and like AbrahamHicks，says it's just my job to feel my way there。。

And so a lot of you want to think about it，through feelings a lot of people are holding。

an identity that doesn't let them feel their，way there。。

It keeps knocking them out of the feeling and，they don't understand what's going on because。

it's a deep-rooted unconscious identity。，This is why they call it shadow work。。

Don't be afraid of the word shadow or the，term shadow work。。

It just means it's an aspect of yourself that，you haven't noticed yet or maybe you did。

know something was there but you're kind of，like not willing to look at it， right？。

You're kind of nervous。，You're not willing to look at it。，So they call it shadow work because you're。

 bringing light to the unconscious aspects of，yourself that you were not aware of。。

So when I did this work， I was not aware that，my true identity what I was operating from。

in this world was I am an inconvenience to，others。，I don't belong as I am because for most people。

it's a very deep-rooted unconscious belief，but that they don't even realize is driving。

their perceptions。，It's driving their actions the way they speak，talk to each other talk to others。。

You know， here's an example。，We've all done this in life。，Have you ever done something maybe it was。

something you regret or maybe it wasn't，but have you ever done something before an。

action and like later on in life it could，have been a few minutes later a few hours。

weeks days maybe even years you took an action，and then later on in life you were just like。

why did I do that？，Why did I act that way？，Why did I you're like why did I do that。

because it was a behavior driven from the，on it's an unconscious action driven from，this identity。。

So that's why I told you if you say SP，loves me but you're actually get out of。

that rampage your first unconscious action，without even second guessing it is just to。

go straight to Facebook and start stalking，them。，That's what's showing you what you truly。

believe you are。，I'm not saying what you believe you are as，you're a stalker， but it's the action。。

It's showing you that you have an identity，that doesn't match what you keep assuming。

because you're if you assumed it was done，you wouldn't be stalking Facebook， right？。

You didn't have to worry about it shows，up when it shows up another example right。

with the business if I say that my business，is successful。，I am a business a successful businessman。

a business woman。，I am a millionaire， right？，But the second I come out of that scene that。

affirmation episode scripting session if，my immediate unconscious action I do。

without even second guessing or thinking，or or even realizing I'm doing it is to。

just go to my website man。，Nobody's booking。，Maybe I should lower my prices。，Maybe I should um。

 you know， maybe I，should just put some advertisement out，there。，I don't know what I got to do。。

That's showing you you have an identity，that doesn't match the successful business。

that you keep talking about or the，perception you're changing。。

So just wanted to make this video to help，you guys。，And so this is the main point I'm making。

right here。，If any of you are struggling over something，，I don't want you to think of it as God has。

forsaken me。，My prayer is not being answered。，Manifestation doesn't work。，Maybe over this subject。。

Maybe sometimes it does。，Maybe it doesn't。，I just can't figure it out。，I'm not believing enough。。

I'm not affirming enough。，It has nothing to do with any of that。。

The mirror of life is reflecting what you，are dominantly embodying not who you。

think you are logically what you are，embodying。，So when you're doing an affirmation a。

perception change，are you doing it from，desperation and lack and need？。

Because if you are it doesn't care how，much you say the affirmation appear in，the logical mind。。

It's responding to the desperation the，lack and the need behind it。。

That's what it's reflecting responding to，or are you saying a perception shift，because you know。

it's already done，because knowing that it's done is not，based on the physical。。

It's based on an internal knowing，because you're changing the perception。

from a an inner calm and knowing，because you have an identity at starting。

to match it affirmation scripting，and visualizing are not negative or，positive。。

It's what is your relationship to it？，And this is why I keep telling people。

being introspective examining within，like Neville Goddard said you have。

all of the answers within examining，within is going to be the key to your，freedom。。

The freedom is not in the next video。，It's not in the next 20 books。。

It's not in the next affirmation。，It is within sure you can have videos。

like this one or books that help you，but ultimately when you finish，watching this video。

you're going to，do the introspective work。，Not me not some stranger in the。

comments is going to answer for you，what your limiting belief is or，your identity。。

You're going to answer it because，nobody has lived and looked through。

your eyes and gone through your，experience through your senses except，for you。。

So how do you start getting to，the bottom of it？，Start noticing your triggers start。

noticing your triggers and asking，who was I being in that moment？，Just let the pin flow and tell you。

who you were being jot down that，answer and then let's say you have。

twenty more triggers doesn't matter，how many triggers you have jot the，answers down。。

Maybe you come down to four different，beliefs right or four different，feelings。。

I was feeling rejected。，I wasn't feeling I was feeling not，seen or heard random things right。

just examples。，Let's see like four different ones。，Maybe you can put those together。

like on a piece of paper and start，to formulate a sentence that really，resonates like oh。

 this is what's，been going on。，Oh， this is where all this rejection，is stemming from。，Yes。

 I have been feeling rejected。，Yes， I have been feeling notseen，or heard。，Yes。

 I have been feeling not good，enough but when I put it all together。

those feelings it was coming from，this right here。，So yes， like I said before。

I was coming from I definitely had，major feelings of rejection and，unworthiness and all that stuff，。

right。，But when I put it all together and，came down to it， it was coming from。

it was stemming from the core of it，was I am an inconvenience to others。，I don't belong as I am。。

So I hope this video helps just，remember the mirror of life does not，discriminate。。

So it's not telling you no to your，and to your prayer to your manifestation。。

If you've been trying for a really，long time and struggling and you're，really attached。

 it's not telling，you know。，Remember this guys just like Neville，Goddard said express gratitude for。

your circumstances for they are，revealing to you who you believe，you really are。。

It's not the physicality of the，circumstances don't get lost in，the physical way the circumstance。

looks examine your emotional reaction，behind it。，Who was I being in that moment？。

It doesn't matter if in one day，somebody cut you off on the road。

and you got triggered your sp didn't，text you or maybe you don't have。

an sp still and you notice you don't，have an sp and got triggered， right？，They're not here yet。。

You lost the five dollar bill in，your pocket。，Somebody scratched your car even。

though those all look physically，different。，Don't worry about the physicality。

of them examine the emotional reaction，behind it。，The only reason you emotionally。

react to anything is because in，that moment you were believing，something about yourself and for。

most people it's a deep-rooted，unconscious belief。，So do the free flow journaling，，right？。

What was I believing？，Get your answers and start to，connect the dots and you'll most。

likely get to the bottom of what，that sentence is。，So hope this video helps you guys。
